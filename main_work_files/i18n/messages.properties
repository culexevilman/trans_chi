label.about=About
label.about.unsene=About Unseen
about.paragraph.1=Unseen brings consumers and businesses very strong secure and private communications.  Our skilled and experienced team have been building popular web sites and services since 1995.  Before starting Unseen, we developed Before It\u2019s News, a leading source of alternative news and information.  Because of this, we\u2019ve had numerous people share with us their concerns about internet communications security.  We\u2019ve been aware of most of the recent revelations for years.
about.paragraph.2=Our premise is that everyone needs to be able to hear the truth so they can make a good choice for their future.  If your communications isn\u2019t secure, it could be monitored, blocked or changed without you knowing it.  That\u2019s not good for anyone.
about.paragraph.3=With all the recent spying disclosures, we became concerned about the safety of our customer\u2019s data, so we moved the company and servers to Iceland.  Iceland has a good track record of doing the right thing for protecting privacy and their past behavior with the bankers and human rights.  It\u2019s a neutral country where during the height of the cold war, this is where Reagan and Gorbachev had their famous meetings.  It\u2019s a very developed country with state of the art data centers where your data is safe and under the protection of Icelandic laws.  Our Icelandic director is firmly in control of any requests for data and will do everything legally possible to protect our customer\u2019s communications.
about.paragraph.4=In the future, expect many upgrades to our systems, as we stay abreast of the latest encryption and security technology and do everything we can to continue to earn your trust.

### FAQ page
label.faq=FAQ
label.faq.question=Frequently Asked Questions

faq.what.does.unseen.do.q=What does Unseen do?
faq.what.does.unseen.do.a=Our service provides privacy and security for messaging, email and calling.  We offer a website, mobile apps and desktop clients that all work together to help you securely communicate wherever you are.
faq.whats.the.goal.of.unseen.q=What\u2019s the goal of Unseen?
faq.whats.the.goal.of.unseen.a=Our goal is to restore the human right to communicate freely and learn the truth. Today, messages are intercepted and stored for a variety of purposes.  When someone can get a copy of a message and read it while it\u2019s in transit, it\u2019s also possible that they could block it or modify it under certain circumstances.  What kind of world would we have if you couldn\u2019t openly share your thoughts with others?  This is the reason we built Unseen.
faq.where.are.you.based.q=Where are you based?
faq.where.are.you.based.a=Our company and servers are based in Iceland, where very strict data privacy laws help to protect your information.  Icelanders are fiercely independent and have protected the rights of others, including Falun Gong
faq.what.platforms.available.q=On what platforms is Unseen available?
faq.what.platforms.available.a=We currently offer a web-based version and will soon have a beta version of Windows, Mac and Ubuntu clients for user testing. Android is coming on strong and iPhone versions will be coming shortly, too. All applications are free to download. We feel people want to access their secure messages whereever they go.
faq.why.do.i.need.this.service.q=Why do I need this service?
faq.why.do.i.need.this.service.a=If you value your privacy and security, then you need a service that protects your communications. Most email apps, social networks and chat applications don\u2019t have very robust security, are commonly hacked, and even read your messages to target advertising and for other purposes. It has also been recently revealed that they have been handing over data in bulk to various spies and agencies. Additionally, even if you don\u2019t have an account on a web-based email service, when you send a message to someone who does, that service reads your email and creates a profile on you and stores and shares that information, too. Unseen is different. We use very strong security to stop hackers and spies and never, ever read any of your messages. Only you keep the key with Unseen.
faq.how.does.it.work.q=How does it work?
faq.how.does.it.work.a=We use a hybrid peer-to-peer and hosted network solution for transmission of encrypted messages. Messages are encrypted and decrypted by each person sending or receiving a message. They are never decrypted along the way (we don\u2019t have the key). This is done automatically and is transparent to the user and our services will appear on the surface to work the same as the regular free email or chat services.
faq.what.kind.encryption.q=What kind of encryption do you offer?
faq.what.kind.encryption.a= Messages on our service are sent using 4096-bit encryption, which is considered extremely strong. you generate your keys with extremely strong lattice based encryption. To that, we add an advanced symmetrical encryption which is very easy to use with keys 16x longer than those found in AES256, an industry standard. According to our engineers, this will take 23840 times longer to crack than aes256, which is commonly known as "military grade" encryption.
faq.how.stop.hackers.q=How do you stop hackers from getting access to my data?
faq.how.stop.hackers.a1=Data from each of your messages is encrypted separately, with your key -- even we can\u2019t read your messages.
faq.how.stop.hackers.a2=The other approach that hackers use is that they try to hack the server itself. If they are successful then it is like a treasure chest of user data. But not with Unseen. All data from each account is encrypted separately so even if a hacker got access to any data on the server, he would have no way to locate your data and even if he decrypted one small piece of data, he wouldn\u2019t have access to the rest of the data.
faq.how.stop.hackers.a3=If you use only the peer to peer client, none of your data will be on our servers, so if someone hacked our servers, they wouldn\u2019t have access to any of your data.
faq.presently.i.use.skype.q=Presently I use Skype, can I continue to use it?
faq.presently.i.use.skype.a=You can keep using Skype, but that\u2019s not as secure because most Skype communications now go through the central datacenter.  They keep the keys to the encryption and they are out of your contro.  We don\u2019t recommend it, but if you have a lot of people still using Skype, you might need to keep using it.  Be sure to completely kill the app if you are not using it, it\u2019ll consume a lot of cpu and bandwidth.
faq.do.you.offer.encrypted.file.storage.q=Do you offer encrypted file storage?
faq.do.you.offer.encrypted.file.storage.a=Right now, encryption is applied only to documents sent through our system.  Encryption is not yet available for documents stored on your local computer.   However, we\u2019re working on some things to enable through our new Iceland based cloud storage.
faq.do.i.need.a.new.email.address.q=Do I need a new email address or can I keep the one I have?
faq.do.i.need.a.new.email.address.a1=You can keep the one you have, but you\u2019ll be given a new one at unseen.is.  Let\u2019s say you get the account name penelope.  The email will automatically be penelope@unseen.is.
faq.do.i.need.a.new.email.address.a2=It\u2019s a completely separate email address from your other account.
faq.can.i.send.emails.messages.to.parties.outside.of.unseen.q=Can I send emails/chat messages to parties outside of Unseen?
faq.can.i.send.emails.messages.to.parties.outside.of.unseen.a1=You can send  emails to third party addresses. In most cases emails sent to third party addresses will be unencrypted.  You can also send encrypted emails to the third party address, but the third party email service would have to be using the same encryption that we use (currently PGP)  and you would need your recipients public key.  Otherwise it would be impossible for them to decrypt the message.  If you don\u2019t have your recipients public key, your message will be sent without encryption.
faq.can.i.send.emails.messages.to.parties.outside.of.unseen.a2=It\u2019s more secure for both of you if are using unseen.is because the email won\u2019t be travelling over the internet as email.  It\u2019ll go from your computer to our server, then to the recipient\u2019s computer in an encrypted tunnel.
faq.can.i.send.emails.messages.to.parties.outside.of.unseen.a3=The chat feature is only from Unseen user to Unseen user..  For chat we use a very specific encryption that no other services use, so they would never be able to read the messages you sent them.  As a result the chat is a closed system.  This makes the chat system significantly more secure.
faq.for.audio.or.video.calling.q=For audio or video calling, do both sides need to be using Unseen?
faq.for.audio.or.video.calling.a=For calling, you have to both be using Unseen.  That\u2019s the only way we can guarantee you\u2019ll be secure and that things are compatible.  Calls will be able to work between the web, desktop clients (win, mac, ubuntu) and mobile apps.
faq.web.services.less.secure.q=Isn\u2019t a web service less secure?
faq.web.services.less.secure.a=Our services are developed to provide the highest level of security widely available on the web. We expect to continue improving and developing better solutions to protect your information. Applications specific to a particular operating system do offer more security, but the web is extremely convenient because you can get your messages anywhere, even if you are borrowing someone elses computer.
faq.difference.free.premium.q=What\u2019s the difference between the free version and the premium version?
faq.difference.free.premium.a=The free version provides a modest amount of free encrypted storage and allows sharing of files of up to 50MB. The premium version provides 2GB of encrypted storage, file sharing up to 40GB, group audio/video calling, and premium users can generate and store their own private key.
faq.terrorists.use.q=How do you make sure terrorists don\u2019t use your platform to do bad stuff?
faq.terrorists.use.a=How do you know terrorists arent using Google? (They probably do!) Bad people use all kinds of different things like telephones and cars and we don\u2019t stop using those because they might be misused by someone. We don\u2019t intentionally look to serve terrorists or people who commit acts of violence or steal or damage property.
faq.requst.from.goverment.q=What if you get a request from the government to hand everything over?
faq.requst.from.goverment.a=Because we\u2019re based in Iceland, we have to follow Icelandic laws.   That means that if we receive a warrant for a particular person that is issued in Iceland and valid there, our Icelandic director will evaluate the request.  If he finds that it\u2019s a legally valid request and reasonable, the information we have from a particular person will have to be turned over.  It\u2019s illegal in Iceland to create a "backdoor" or give anyone bulk access to the data.  Because we don\u2019t keep the key, all messages are encrypted.  We can only provide whatever data we have for the user and if the user\u2019s profile settings don\u2019t store data on our servers, we might have an email address and that\u2019s about it.

landing.strongest.encryption=The Strongest Encryption on the Web with NO Backdoor
landing.strongest.encryption.paragraph.1=Most commercially available encryption has been intentionally crippled to make it strong enough to keep out some of the bad guys, but not Big Brother. They\u2019ve done this for many years, and it\u2019s weakened the security for everyone\u2019s valued private communications because now others can exploit these weaknesses. To counter this, we started with proven but lesser known algorithms (the formulas that scramble your messages) that are very difficult to break.  We increased the strength while building everything from scratch, so we can control every aspect and keep out the back doors.
landing.strongest.encryption.paragraph.2=<span class="body_font">We call this encryption &quot;</span><span class="orange_bold">QUANTUM SHIELD</span><span class="body_font">&quot;. It\u2019s designed to keep most everything out of your messages, even the latest generation of quantum computers.  Big Brother uses all kinds of technology including quantum computers to break into your messages, so you need a shield that resists even that kind of effort. You generate your keys with extremely strong lattice based encryption, which is believed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks. To that, we add an advanced symmetrical encryption which is very easy to use with keys 16x longer than those found in AES256, an industry standard. According to our engineers, this will take 2<sup>3840</sup> times longer to crack than AES256, which is commonly known as "military grade" encryption. We also offer One Time Pad (coming Dec. 1), a proven system which is immune to cryptanalysis. The entire system has been designed to give you peace of mind and as the technology changes, we will be updating and improving the encryption and security. We\u2019ve made things super simple. All of this high-tech is done behind the scenes, while the experience of using Unseen is much like you\u2019d get with Skype and the web based email you use every day.</span>

landing.you.keep.the.keys.paragraph=<span class="body_font">We put </span><span class="orange_bold">YOU</span><span class="body_font"> in control with the keys, only you have them with Unseen. Most Big Name services keep the keys and don\u2019t even tell you they have them.  They also hand them out to others without telling you, which completely defeats the purpose of encryption.  With Unseen, you keep control of your keys, whether they are only stored on your computer (safest), or they are encrypted with a password only you know and stored on our servers (safe, but more convenient).  Either way, you are in control because you decide how much security you want.

### Security page
label.security=Security
security.paragraph.1=Unseen is the first secure web-based communications platform.
security.paragraph.2=We create a secure tunnel for your information between your computer, our server and the recipient using 2048-bit RSA encryption, with any web browser like Firefox, Chrome, Opera.
security.paragraph.3=Then we encrypt each conversation with a separate 256-bit AES encryption, adding another layer of even higher security.
security.paragraph.4=So even if someone were able to break into the tunnel, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to read the messages, because of the AES encryption of the messages.
security.paragraph.5=Plus, since each conversation is encrypted differently, if the hacker were able to eventually decipher one conversation, the other conversations would still remain encrypted.
security.paragraph.6=In addition, in the premium version, every message is encrypted differently, so even if one message is intercepted and deciphered, the snooper can\u2019t decrypt the other messages the same way.
security.paragraph.7=Let me translate this tech talk: It\u2019s like going into a private, soundproof room with only you and your friend in it. Then just in case the room were bugged, you would speak in a code language that\u2019s specifically created for that conversation.

Unseen is committed to protecting the privacy of any personally identifiable information that Unseen may collect from you when you use the website at www.unseen.is (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) or the Service. This notice sets forth Unseen\u2019s Privacy Policy. By accessing, using or registering at the Website or using the Service you are confirming your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You should also review Unseen\u2019s Terms of Service for more information about the policies governing your use of the Website and the Service.
privacy.policy.1= 1. THE SERVICE. Unseen\u2019s Service encrypts your email messages using encryption keys that are themselves encrypted based on your passphrase. Only you know your passphrase. The Service transmits and stores your email messages, but Unseen and its personnel cannot decrypt these email messages because to do so your passphrase is needed, but is not available. Further, premium service users have the option of keeping their encryption keys exclusively. Upon a lawful demand by a court or other governmental authority, Unseen may be required to provide your encrypted email message files and your encrypted keys. Unseen, however, does not have access to your passphrase and thus is unable to provide it to third parties.
privacy.policy.2.1=2. INFORMATION COLLECTED. Unseen in good faith will keep the information we collect from you at the minimum and only to the extent necessary to provide you the Service. When you register you are asked to provide Unseen with email address, telephone number and other personal identifying information. If you provide such information Unseen will store such information required to provide you with the Service. Unseen also collects your internet protocol (IP address). Unseen also collects and stores personal identifying information required when you pay for the premium Service. The personal identifying information collected for the payment transaction may include your name, address, telephone number, credit card number and credit card security code. Unseen will not store any credit card information other than your name, purchase price, the date of purchase and what services were purchased.
privacy.policy.2.2=We may also automatically collect and store certain information, mainly non-personal identifying information, when you visit the Website and use the Service. For example, we may use \u201ccookies\u201d to obtain information when you access this website. Such information may include your browser type, the date and time of your visit, your hardware type and model, your device identifier, the operating system of your computer, network information, and the domain name of your internet service provider. This information is used to facilitate access to and improve the Website and Service and to provide the Service.
privacy.policy.2.3=Unseen, ehf., Reg.id. 420413-0680, Idunnarbrunni 5, 113 Reykjavik, Iceland, is considered a controller in relation to the processing of these personal information collected.
privacy.policy.3.1=3. USE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. All personal identifying information, such as email address, phone number or other personal identifying information, provided to Unseen by you is private and will be used only (a) to provide the Service, (b) to provide you notices about the Service, (c) to process your payments, (d) to validate your email address or phone number, and (e) if you grant Unseen permission, to link Unseen\u2019s users with each other.
privacy.policy.3.2=At any time, you may choose to no longer receive emails from Unseen by contacting us at support@unseen.is.
privacy.policy.3.3=In order to provide the Service, Unseen might be required to share personal identifying information with third parties, such as credit card processing companies.
