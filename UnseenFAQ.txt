Frequently Asked Questions

What does Unseen do?

Our services provide private and secure messaging, email and calling. We offer web, mobile and desktop apps that will allow secure communication wherever you are.

 

What’s the goal of Unseen?

Open and free communications are critical in restoring the people's rights to obtain the truth. Today, data is intercepted and snooped upon for various reasons and purposes. When someone can read your information while it’s in transit, it’s easy to block the recipient from receiving or change the content all without your permission. This is the reason Unseen was built.

 

Where are you based?

Our company and servers are based in Iceland, protected by some of the strictest data privacy laws on the planet.

 

On what platforms is Unseen available?

We are currently in beta with apps available for Web browsers, Windows, Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux. Android is available now and iOS is coming soon.

 

Why do I need this service?

If you value privacy, security and freedom, then you need to start protecting your online communications today. Most email and chat, and social networking sites do not value users privacy and security, they are hacked consistently, and read your personal messages to target advertise and other nefarious purposes.

 

How does it work?

We provide end to end encryption for all transmissions of data. Data is encrypted and decrypted only by the sender or the receiver. We do not have the key and it will never be decrypted along the way. As its all done in the background. So to the end-user, it will just feel and work the same way as if using regular email or chat services.

 
 
What kind of encryption do you offer?

We utilize industry standard openpgp encryption for email and TLS 2048bit for audio/video calls. For chat we use an much stronger xAES algorithm and NTRU for key exchanging instead of RSA, as RSA has known to be broken, long key generation times on mobile devices etc.

 

How do you stop hackers from getting access to my data?

Data from each of your messages is encrypted separately, with your key -- even we can’t read your messages.

The other approach that hackers use is that they try to hack the server itself. If they are successful then it is like a treasure chest of user data. But not with Unseen. All data from each account is encrypted separately so even if a hacker got access to any data on the server, he would have no way to locate your data and even if he decrypted one small piece of data, he wouldn’t have access to the rest of the data.

If you use only the peer to peer client, none of your data will be on our servers, so if someone hacked our servers, they wouldn’t have access to any of your data.
 


Do you offer encrypted file storage?

Right now, encryption is applied only to files sent through our system. Encryption is not yet available for documents stored on your local computer. However, we’re working on enabling our new cloud storage based in Iceland.

 

Do I need a new email address or can I keep the one I have?

You can keep the one you have, but you’ll be given a new one at unseen.is. Let’s say you get the account name penelope. The email will automatically be penelope@unseen.is.

It’s a completely separate email address from your other account.

 

Can I send emails/chat messages to parties outside of Unseen?

You can send emails to third party addresses. In most cases emails sent to third party addresses will be unencrypted. You can also send encrypted emails to the third party address, but the third party email service would have to be using the same encryption that we use (currently PGP) and you would need your recipients public key. Otherwise it would be impossible for them to decrypt the message. If you don’t have your recipients public key, your message will be sent without encryption.

It’s more secure for both of you if are using unseen.is because the email won’t be travelling over the internet as email. It’ll go from your computer to our server, then to the recipient’s computer in an encrypted tunnel.

The chat feature is only from Unseen user to Unseen user.. For chat we use a very specific encryption that no other services use, so they would never be able to read the messages you sent them. As a result the chat is a closed system. This makes the chat system significantly more secure.

 

For audio or video calling, do both sides need to be using Unseen?

For calling, you have to both be using Unseen. That’s the only way we can guarantee you’ll be secure and that things are compatible. Calls will be able to work between the web, desktop clients (win, mac, ubuntu) and mobile apps.

 

Isn’t a web service less secure?

Our services are developed to provide the highest level of security widely available on the web. We expect to continue improving and developing better solutions to protect your information. Applications specific to a particular operating system do offer more security, but the web is extremely convenient because you can get your messages anywhere, even if you are borrowing someone elses computer.

 

What’s the difference between the free version and the premium version?

The free version provides a modest amount of free encrypted storage and allows sharing of files of up to 50MB. The premium version provides 2GB of encrypted storage, file sharing up to 40GB, group audio/video calling, and premium users can generate and store their own private key.
 

 
What if you get a request from the government to hand everything over?

Because we’re based in Iceland, we have to follow Icelandic laws. That means that if we receive a warrant for a particular person that is issued in Iceland and valid there, our Icelandic director will evaluate the request. If he finds that it’s a legally valid request and reasonable, the information we have from a particular person will have to be turned over. It’s illegal in Iceland to create a "backdoor" or give anyone bulk access to the data. Because we don’t keep the key, all messages are encrypted. We can only provide whatever data we have for the user and if the user’s profile settings don’t store data on our servers, we might have an email address and that’s about it.

 

How do I upgrade my free account to premium?

To upgrade your account, just log into your account and click on the Upgrade to Premium button in the menu bar at the top of the page. From here you will be taken to a payment page. If you are only purchasing a single upgrade, the account you are logged into will be upgraded automatically after payment.

 

I have several accounts that need to be upgraded, can this be done?

If you are purchasing multiple upgrades, you will receive an upgrade code that can be used to upgrade exactly the number of accounts that you purchased. To upgrade with an upgrade code that you have previously purchased, click the ’Upgrade to Premium’ button, paste in your upgrade code in the form and submit the form.

 

Do you offer an affiliate program?

Do you want to earn money for referring user to Unseen? We offer an affiliate program for all of our premium account holders. If you have a premium account, you are already an Unseen affiliate.

I have forgotten my password and/or username, how can I retrieve them?

When at the Unseen login page, click on the ’Forgot Password’ link. Enter your username or email id and click on the ’Reset password’. Please not that if you have defined a different email address (other than username@unseen.is) as your primary email account, you need to check that email account for new mail and get your password from there.
