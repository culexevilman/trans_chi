Frequently Asked Questions

What does Unseen do?

Our services provide private and secure messaging, email and calling. We offer web, mobile and desktop apps that will allow secure communication wherever you are.



What is the mission of Unseen?

To provide a safe and secure platform for dissemination of magnificent information that is ceaseless and uncontrollable.

Open and free communications are critical in allowing the people to obtain truthful knowledge. Today, data is intercepted and snooped upon for various reasons and purposes. When someone can read your information while it’s in transit, it’s easy to block the recipient from ever receiving or change the content all without your permission. This is the reason Unseen was built. We also believe in giving full support for groups or individuals who needs security and privacy, like media reporters, whisle-blowers, people who living under state-control and media-censorship. Especially heavily persecuted groups in Communist countries such as Falun Gong, Christians, Tibetans etc.



Where is Unseen based?

Our company and servers are based in Iceland, protected by some of the strictest data privacy laws on the planet.



What platforms is Unseen available on?

We are currently in beta with apps available for Web browsers, Windows, Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux. Android is available now and iOS is coming soon.



Why do I need Unseen?

If you value privacy, security and freedom, then you need to start protecting your online communications today. Most email and chat, and social networking sites do not value users privacy and security, they are hacked consistently, and read your personal messages to target advertise and other nefarious purposes.



How does it work?

We provide end to end encryption for all transmissions of data. Data is encrypted and decrypted only by the sender or the receiver. We do not have the key and it will never be decrypted along the way. As its all done in the background. So to the end-user, it will just feel and work the same way as if using regular email or chat services.



What kind of encryption does Unseen offer?

We utilize industry standard openPGP encryption for email and TLS 2048 bits for audio/video calls. For chat we use an much stronger xAES algorithm and NTRU for key exchanging instead of RSA, as RSA is known to be broken, long key generation times on mobile devices etc.



How does Unseen prevent someone from getting access to my data?

Data from each of your messages is encrypted separately with your key, so even we can’t decrypt your messages.

We take many steps in guarding access to the server itself. All data from each account is encrypted separately so even if any data were stolen, theres no way to locate your data and even in the unlikely scenario a chunk of data was successfully stolen and decrypted, its a negligible piece of the puzzle compared to the rest.

If you use only p2p connections, none of your data will be on our servers, so if someone without authorization accessed our servers, they will get nothing.



Do you offer encrypted file storage?

The quality and security that goes into each GB we offer is unparalleled. So with such an advanced infrastructure, encryption is applied only to files sent through our system. Encryption is not yet available for files stored on your local computer. However, our new cloud storage based in Iceland is in the works.



Do I need a new email address or can I keep the one I have?

You can keep the one you have, but you’ll be given a new one at unseen.is. Let’s say you get the account name johndoe. The email will automatically be johndoe@unseen.is.

It’s a complete secure and isolated email address compared with the rest of your accounts.



Can I send emails to people outside of Unseen?

You can send emails to third party addresses. In most cases emails sent to third party addresses will be unencrypted. You can also send encrypted emails to third party addresses, but they would need to utilize the same level of encryption that we use and you would need your recipients public key. Otherwise it would be impossible for them to decrypt the message. If you don’t have your recipients public key, your message will be sent without any encryption.

It’s highly recommended for both of you to use Unseen, simply because the content will not be transmitted over the internet as regular email. It’ll go from your computer directly to our secured servers, then to the recipient’s computer in a heavily encrypted tunnel.



Can I send chat messages to people outside of Unseen?

The highly secure chat feature is only available from user to user with Unseen accounts. For chat we use a very specific and highly exclusive encryption that no other services provides, so they would never be able to read the messages you sent them.



For audio or video calling, do both sides need to be using Unseen?

For calling, you both have to be using Unseen. It’s the only way we can guarantee your security and that things are compatible. Calls are cross-platform compatible between web, desktop and mobile apps.



Isn’t a web service less secure?

Our services are developed to provide the highest level of security available. Apps specific to a particular operating system are custom tailored, and offer more security. But the web app is extremely convenient because you can get your messages anywhere with access to the internet.



What’s the difference between Unseen basic and premium accounts?

Basic accounts provides lightweight security for your online communication needs, a modest amount of storage with standard encryption, Limited calling features and basic email.

Premium accounts offers maximum security for your online communication needs, 2GB of storage with the strongest tier of encryption available, up to 40GB of file sharing, unlimited individual and group calling, and the ability to generate and store your own private key.


Do you keep login data of any kind?

While we do value your privacy, for us to keep our service live and running, we do need retain some login data for up to 2 weeks. We do not have anything beyond that point.



What if you get a request from the government to hand over information?

Because we’re based in Iceland, we are bound by Icelandic laws. So if we receive a valid warrant issued in Iceland for a particular person, we will throughly evaluate the request. If in case its a legal valid and reasonable request, the information we have from that particular person will have to be turned over. Note its illegal in Iceland to create a "backdoor" or givebulk access to the data. Because we don’t keep the key, and all messages are encrypted. We can only provide whatever data we have for the user and if the user’s profile settings do not store data on our servers, we might have an email address and that’s about it.



How do I upgrade my basic account to premium?
